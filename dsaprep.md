## What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

You should consider what you are gonna want to do with the specific data structure. Are you gonna be adding new items, deleting items or retreiving items. This is because almost every data structure has its pros and cons in terms of what it can and cant do.

## How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

When you write a recursive function you have to tell it when to stop. Thats why we have a base case i.e. when the function doesn't call itself again , to ensure we dont go into an infinite loop

## Things I want to Know More About

I want to learn more about Big O notation. I feel like the readings didnt go quite deep into it.
