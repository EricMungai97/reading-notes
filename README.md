# My Code Fellows Reading Notes!
## *My reading notes*

Hi my name is **Eric Mungai Kinuthia!** I have a background in Finance from the University of Nairobi in Kenya. I am passionate about learning code, because it is a fun way to solve problems in our day to day life.

### Growth Mindset

To me '''Growth''' Mindset is taking on challenges and learning from them to improve yourself and your abilities. It is choosing not to get caught up in negative thinking when you face setbacks and believing you can always improve on yourself. :smile:

***3 Reminders to keep myself in the Growth Mindset***

- No pain, No gain!
- Feedback and criticism help me grow as a person!
- No one was good when they started learning!
