# Psychological safety

 This topic matters to me because it is key to fostering a good relationship with my teammates at the work place and in other settings.It teaches me to create a condusive work environment where everyone can speak up, share ideas, ask questions and make mistakes without fearing. 

## What is psycholgical safety

It is the belief that you won't be punished or humiliated for speaking up with ideas, questions, concerns or mistakes.

[cite](https://www.ccl.org/articles/leading-effectively-articles/what-is-psychological-safety-at-work/)

In my previous work setting I was afraid of speaking up because employee concerns were hardly ever taken seriously. There were certain conditions in the workplace that made my tasks difficult to perform. Worn out driver seats, missing back up cameras etc. Whenever I voiced my concerns my employee just shrugged it off. This resulted to me hating my job and later on quitting. If my employee knew about psychological safety things would have been very different.

A boss knowledgable on pyschological safety would have a work setting where employee concerns receive feedback and are acted upon. Employees shouldn't be afraid to speak up they should know it is safe to contribute. Respect also goes both ways. Poor working conditions goes to show you don't respect your employees. This makes them feel neglected and not included in your team because you don't care for them. Bosses should be open to feedback and include employees in decision making.
