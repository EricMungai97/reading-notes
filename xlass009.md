# Stacks and Queues

## Stacks

A stack is a data structure that consists of `Nodes`. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

Common terminology for a stack is

* Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed

* Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.

* Top - This is the top of the stack.

* Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.

* IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

Stacks follow these concepts:

FILO

`First In Last Out`

This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.
LIFO

`Last In First Out`

This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

`Push O(1)`

Pushing a Node onto a stack will always be an `O(1)` operation. This is because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many Nodes (n) you have in the stack.

```
    def push(self, value):
        # Adds node to the top of the stack
        if self.top is None:
            self.top = Node(value)
            return
        old = self.top
        self.top = Node(value)
        self.top.next = old

```

`Pop O(1)`

Popping a Node off a stack is the action of removing a Node from the top. When conducting a pop, the top Node will be re-assigned to the Node that lives below and the top Node is returned to the user.

```
 def pop(self):
        # Remove top node from stack, Returns value of removed node.
        if self.top is None:
            raise InvalidOperationError("Method not allowed on empty collection")
        popped = self.top
        self.top = self.top.next
        return popped.value

```

`Peek O(1)`

When conducting a peek, you will only be inspecting the top Node of the stack.

Typically, you would check isEmpty before conducting a peek. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. Alternately, you can wrap the
call in a try/catch block.

```
    def pop(self):
        # Remove top node from stack, Returns value of removed node.
        if self.top is None:
            raise InvalidOperationError("Method not allowed on empty collection")
        popped = self.top
        self.top = self.top.next
        return popped.value
```

## Queues

Common terminology for a queue is

* Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.

* Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.

* Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.

* Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.

* Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.

* IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.

Queues follow these concepts:

`FIFO`

First In First Out

This means that the first item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue.

`LILO`

Last In Last Out

This means that the last item in the queue will be the last item out of the queue.

***Enqueue O(1)***

When you add an item to a queue, you use the enqueue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it does not matter how many other items live in the queue (n); it takes the same amount of time to perform the operation.

```
    def enqueue(self, value):
        # check to see if queue is empty
        if self.rear:
            self.rear.next = Node(value)
            self.rear = self.rear.next
            return
        self.rear = self.front = Node(value)

```

***Dequeue O(1)***

When you remove an item from a queue, you use the dequeue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it doesnâ€™t matter how many other items are in the queue, you are always just removing the front Node of the queue.

Typically, you would check isEmpty before conducting a dequeue. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. Alternately, you can wrap the call in a try/catch block.

```
    def dequeue(self):
        if self.front is None:
            raise InvalidOperationError
        else:
            dequeued = self.front
            self.front = self.front.next
            return dequeued.value
```
