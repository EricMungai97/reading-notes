# Engineer Readings

## What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

I am a detailed-oriented, creative thinker who is constantly looking for new ways to learn and grow .

## What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

1. I will first step away from the computer for a little bit.

2. I will then try and go step by step through my code to figure out where I went wrong (Debug).

3. I will reassess i.e. I will try and look at the problem from another perspective to see if I can break it down into something I can tackle.

4. I will research on places like stack overflow and google to see what other did who have encountered same problem as me.
If nothing works I will delete everything and start anew.
