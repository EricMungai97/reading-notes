# Growth Mindset

This topic matters to me because it molds me into a person who views every challenge as something to learn from and someone who can develop any of my abilities through dedication and hardwork.

I previously worked as a delivery driver for Amazon. Prime week was a really challenging week because the volume of the orders were really big. My van would be jam packed to the extent I wouldn't have space to maneuvre to get packages. Instead of giving up on the job, I adapted and taught myself a unique way to organize my van so the delivery of the packages would be easy no matter how many packages they gave me to deliver.
