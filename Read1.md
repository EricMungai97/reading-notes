# Class 1 Reading Notes

## Pain and Suffering

This topic matters to me because it encourages me to look at the bigger picture whenever things get hard in the upcoming lectures.

Things to remember:

1. All growth comes with some degree of pain as it pulls you out of your comfort zone.

2. The pain is only temporary

3. As you are experience pain seek the remedy

4. Why I am taking this course

5. I am doing this course for my future.

6. Don't confuse pain with suffering - suffering is pain without purpose.

## Beginners Guide to Big O

Big O Notation is used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.

O(l) - an algorithm that executes in the same time or space regardless of the size of the input data set.

O(N) - an algorithm whose ececution grows directly proportional to the size of the input data set.

O(NÂ²) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.

O(2^N) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set

O(l) would be the best algorithm because its performance is the same regardless of the size of the input data set.

## Names and Values in Python

In python names are reassigned independently.

```
x = 23
y = x
x = 12

print (y) # y is still 23
```

In python memory exists dynamically
 ```
 x = "Hello"
 x = "World" #x is now str World.
 ```

 Assignment never copies data

Changing an int: rebinding
```
x = x + 1
```

Changing a list:mutating
```
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
nums.append(7)
```
References can be more than just names

```
nums = [1, 2, 3]
x = nums[1]
```

Immutable values include ints, floats, strings and tuples.
