Scope rules how variables and names are looked up in your code.

Determines the vsibility ofa variable within your code.

Python resolves names using the so-called `LEGB` rule

The letters in LEGB stand for Local, Enclosing, Global, and Built-in.

`Global Scope` names defined in this scope are available to all your code .

`Local scope` names are only available or visble to the code within the scope.

`Enclosing scope` special scope that only exists for nested functions

`Built-in scope` special python scope created or loaded whener you run a script.
