3. Not context specific – designed to operate in different environments and contexts.
4. Extensible – component can be extended from existing component to provide a new behavior.
5. Encapsulated
6. Independent – components are designed to have minimal dependency on other components.

## What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?

1. Ease of deployment
2. Reduce cost
3. Ease of development
4. Reusable
5. Modification of technical complexity
6. Reliability
7. System maintenance and evolution
8. Independent
