# Intro to Django

Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. Built by experienced developers, Django takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel.

**Django Features**

**Object relational mapper**

You can define your data models entirely in Python. Django gives you a rich, dynamic database-access API for free. You can also still write SQL.

**URLs and views**

Django gives you a beautiful URL design and doesn't put any cruft in URLs, like .php or .asp
To design URLs for an application, you create a Python module called a URLconf.

**Templates**

Django’s template language is designed to strike a balance between power and ease. It’s designed to feel comfortable and easy-to-learn to those used to working with HTML, like designers and front-end developers. But it is also flexible and highly extensible, allowing developers to augment the template language as needed.

**Forms**

It provides a powerful form library that handles rendering forms as HTML, validating user-submitted data, and converting that data to native Python types.

It also provides a way to generate forms from your existing models and use those forms to create and update data.

**Authentication**

Django comes with a full-featured and secure authentication system. It handles user accounts, groups, permissions and cookie-based user sessions

**Admin**

One of the most powerful parts of Django is its automatic admin interface. It reads metadata in your models to provide a powerful and production-ready interface that content producers can immediately use to start managing content on your site.

**Internationalization**
 
Django offers full support for translating text into different languages, plus locale-specific formatting of dates, times, numbers, and time zones.

**Security**

Django provides multiple protections against:
* Clickjacking
* Cross-site scripting
* SQL injection
* Remote code execution

## Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework designed to enable users to create applications faster and easier. You can use utility classes to control the layout, color, spacing, typography, shadows, and more to create a completely custom component design — without leaving your HTML or writing a single line of custom CSS.

**Benefits of Tailwind CSS**

1. You write less custom CSS

2. You keep files small

3. You don't have to invent class names

4. You can make safer changes
                                  
## Why Tailwind CSS
                     
Unlike other CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Materialize, Tailwind doesn’t offer fully styled components like buttons, dropdowns, and navbars. Instead, it offers utility classes so you can create your own reusable components.

For that reason, it provides a lot more flexibility and control over what your application looks like than other CSS frameworks. This can enable you to create a more unique site.
