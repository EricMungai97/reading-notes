# Reading Notes 10

## Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error

Syntax errors are spelling erros in your code that  cause your program not to run at all or to stop working part way through whereas logic errors is when your code isn't what you intended it to be therefore giving you diffrent results. This means they are harder to fix.

## List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

1. Syntax errors - I looked for misspellings in my code.
2. Logic errors -I went through my code looking for my mistake.
3. Reference erros
4. Type error.

## How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

This topic will help me easily identify the errors in my code which goes a long way in debugging my code.
It will also help me look up tools to reduce errors in my code making me a better dev.

## How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

It is a tool to help search for and fix errors in your javascript code because when your code contains errors nothing will happen when you run your program,or you will get results you didn't expect.

## Define what a breakpoint is.

 This is the point where you want to pause execution of your debugger.

## What is the call stack?

The section of your debugger that shows what code was executing to get to the current line.
