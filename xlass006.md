The Random module contains some very useful functions namely:

* randint() function - used to createrandom strings within a range. takes two numbers as input arguments.start range and end of the range.

* random() function - used to generate random numbers between 0 and 1

* choice() function - used to select a random element from a collection object like a list.

* randrange() function - used to select a random element from a given range. It takes 3 input argument  numbers namely start, stop and step.

* shuffle() function - shuffles the elements in the list in place.

## What is Risk Analysis

[source](https://www.edureka.co/blog/risk-analysis-in-software-testing/)

`risk analysis` is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test.

Using it at the beginning of the project highlights the potential problem areas helping developers and managers mitigate risk

Risk mitigation tools include: risk assessment meetings, maximum resources on high risk areas , use of risk magnitude indicators and creation of a risk assessment database.

**3 perspectives of risk assessment**

Effect - identify an event and try to determine its impact

Cause - scan a problem to reach the point that could be casuing the problem.

Likelihood - saying that theres a chance a requirement wont be met.

** *3 steps of risk analysis***

* Searching the risk

* Analyzing the impact of each individual risk

* Measures for the risk identified

### Test Coverage

It is a useful tool for finding untested parts of a codebase.

A sign you are testing too much is if your tests are slowing you down.
