## Speed Coding: Building a CRUD API

***Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?***

[Source](https://nordicapis.com/crud-vs-rest-whats-the-difference/)

Interacting with rest applications often involves the use of ```CRUD```- like functions. This is because ```REST``` applications are built around resources, which can be created, read, updated and deleted just like entries in a collection of data. These methods include:

1. GET
2. POST
3. DELETE
4. PUT
5. PATCH

***If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?***

1. Create a server
2. Configure middleware
3. Set up endpoints
4. Set up methods based of end points.
5. Set up error handling
