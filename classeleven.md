[SOURCE](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool)

SQL database are called relational datatabases while noSQL arecalled non relational or distributed data base.

SQL databases are table based whreas NoSql databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores.

SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.

SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.

SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful. In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents.

***What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?***

Data that is structured.

***Give a real world example.***

Employees information for example their name, email, department and their employee id.

***What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?***

 Unstructured or semi structured data like documents and JSON

***Give a real world example.***

JSON like data for exapmle the previous labs weather  json data.

***Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?***

NoSQL as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.

***Which type of database is best for scalability?***

NoSQL because the way it stores data enables it to be scalable horizontally and vertically unlike SQL which is scalable vertically.

***What does SQL stand for?***

***What type of structure does a relational database work with?***

Tabular structure

***What is a ‘schema’?***

A list of logical structures of data.

***What is a NoSQL database?***

Non-tabular databases that store data differently than relational tables
How does it work?

***What is inside of a MongoDB database?***

Collections

Documents

***Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.***

MongoDB becuase it doesn't use predefined schemas

***What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?***

Not a good fit for complex queries. It doesnt have the standard interfaces to perform complex queries, and the queries themselves are not as powerful as SQL query language.
