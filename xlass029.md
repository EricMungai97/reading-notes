Communicate, let the technical interview feel like you are having a conversation with the interviewee.

First restate the question for them and seek affirmation to show you understand what they are asking you to do.

Ask about edge cases.

Think about the inputs and expected output and think about the potential edge cases to the problem.

Think about the potential `edge cases` to the problem. Ask about them

Ask if there are any `test cases` that the function should pass.

Write the pseudocode and ask if it makes sense.

If your pseudocode looks good, but you end up having difficulty translating it to actual code, you have earned a lot of points already

Covert the `pseudocode` into actual code. Ask if your solution looks good. If it doesn't they might offer some tips to improve on it.

If you get stuck, ask for help, you can phrase it in the following manner.

`I'm a bit stuck here, do you have any tips to nudge me in the right direction?`

1. **Take a few minutes**

Don't jump straight into talking and pass up a great opportunity for concentrated thought.

Wait until the interviewer is done explaining the problem, ask clarifying questions , then tell the interviewer:

`“Okay, got it. If it’s okay with you, I’m just going to take a minute or two here and think about the problem, and then I’ll start talking.”`

2. **Write down the steps of the solution**

3. Write the pseudocode first.

Even if we don't make it to code many interviewers will consider this a solution to the problem.

4. **Don't sweat the small stuff**

If you can’t remember something like this, it’s often acceptable to say that you’d look it up.

`…and here, I’d use whatever the list.contains() equivalent is in JavaScript. I know it’s not contains, but I can’t remember the method name right now, so we’ll call it contains() for now and I’d look it up right now if I were coding this.`

5. **Sit down. Be Humble**

If you are given criticism in an interview, take it and be grateful for it. Don't make any snide remarks

6. **Come prepared**

In the interview, knowing that you’ve done all you can to prepare helps you stay calm and cool, and increases your chances of success.

7. **Review your Work**

If you finish before the assigned review your code as you would in a peer review. This helps show the interviewer that you are committed to producing accurate, high-quality work.

Try and make sure your solution is the most optimal in terms of Algorithmic effiency.

Make sure that you have covered all the edge cases
